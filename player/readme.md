MPC is deprecated since 2017, and the [repository](https://github.com/mpc-hc/mpc-hc) itself also has been archived and read-only for now. But the player itself is still great as a media player.

KMPlayer is a fork of MPC (PC, libVLC &rightarrow; Android, mobileVLCkit &rightarrow; iOS), so it doesn't change a lot of the features.
